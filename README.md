# Identifying Oblique Objects in a Cartesian Mesh - Python Code
This version of the code includes functions for oblique rectangular objects. We will consider in the future general oblique objects with arbitrary cross sections.
Example of the Cartesian Mesh is the Yee Cells of the FDTD Algorithm.
Each rectangular object is defined by one corner (x0,y0,z0), the directional unit vectors u_axis[nn][:],v_axis[nn][:],w_axis[nn][:],and the lengths along the the three directions lu[nn],lv[nn],lw[nn] respectively.
The function ReadObjectInfoaAndFindMinMax uses the information that were passed from GUI for the rectangular oblique objects to find Xmin,Xmax,Ymin,Ymax,Zmin
As special cases of the rectangular object are a 2D (rectangle) if lu or lv=0 or a 1D (straight line) if lu=lv=0.
W-direction is the Longitudinal direction
This function will calculate finally in the Cartesian coordinate Xmin,Xmax,Ymin,Ymax,Zmin,Zmax.
The function findCornersObliqueRectangular finds 7 corners of the rectangular object while the first corner xyz0Corner is already given
The function xyzMinMaxRectangular finds Xmin,Xmax,Ymin,Ymax,Zmin,Zmax of the oblique rectangular object
The function checkIfPointInObliqueRectangular checks if the point (x,y,z) is inside the oblique rectangular object or not.
nObjects is the total number of the Oblique Objects in the computational domain
